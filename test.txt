When you are old
William Butler Yeats
When you are old and grey and full of sleep,
And nodding by the fire£¬take down this book,
And slowly read,and dream of the soft look
Your eyes had once,and of their shadows deep;

111112222234444444

And loved your beauty with love false or true,
But one man loved the pilgrim Soul in you
And loved the sorrows of your changing face;
And bending down beside the glowing bars,
Murmur,a little sadly,how Love fled
And paced upon the mountains overhead
